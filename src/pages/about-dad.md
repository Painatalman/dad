# About DAD

Our motivation and principles — it's kinda important, actually!

## Motivation: Why DAD?

Our purpose is to create a knowledge base that's:

- easy to edit, but curated by selected people
- practical, but ownable (we keep all the data easily)
- visually customizable, but functional by default

## Our Priciples and Approach

> Together we write as one!
>
> — The Avengers (probably...)

The basic principles that guide us in our writing. Because this is not an individual effort (we hope...):

- Be **Coherent** with language and terms (see [Style Guide](#style-guide))
- Be **Lean** (“Less is more”)
- Be **Organized**, ensuring a searchable and navigable knowledge base
- Be **Continuous** with regular improvements (supported by user feedback)
- Be **Knowledgeable**, provide well-sourced information
- Be **Specific**, no generic categories (e.g.: miscellaneous, others)

Remember: Follow the CLOCKS!

## Style Guide

- Use simple language, write in English
- Be inclusive, don't use swearing unless so required
- Be wary of humour for technical documentation (i.e.: "docs")
